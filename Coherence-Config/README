Coherence-Config 0.0.1

Coherence-Config is a cross-platform GUI frontend for Coherence, a DLNA/UPnP server. 
It is written in Python and relies on QT4 through the PyQT4 bindings for its GUI.

Coherence-Config is still extremely young and requires a lot of effort before
it can be considered stable.


Dependencies:
Python - Coherence-Config is written in Python and requires it to run.
It has only been tested with Python 2.6.

PyQt4 - PyQt4 powers Coherence-Config's UI. It can be found at www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk.
Many Linux distros such as Ubuntu and Debian have PyQt4 in their default
repositories and can be downloaded with apt-get

Daemon - Coherence-Config uses daemon to start/stop the Coherence UPNP server.
It can be found at http://www.libslack.org/daemon

Coherence - Ironically, Coherence doesn't have to be installed in order for
Coherence-Config to function. However, you will obviously be unable to start
the service. You can still use it to generate XML configuration files.
